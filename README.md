Pull-Request-Me-Please
=============

A repo for testing pull request. Just feel free to send a pull request.

------------------------------

This repo include three files :

  * LICENSE
  * README.md
  * pool.txt

If you would practice how to send a pull request, just fork this repo
and then send the pull request for us.

If your commits just add some lines for `pool.txt`, we will merge it.

If your commits modify `LICENSE`, `README.md` or make other changes,
we will reject it.

We will be happy for your participation. :-)
